# A few Quick Matches: Custom Character Loader
A simple UMT script that imports Custom Character Scripts and sprites directly into the game easily.

# How It Works
The mod loader adds any associated gml scripts, and any associated art for a custom character given it is insde of the "Character Assets" folder.
# How to use 
First before any mod loading, you need UndertaleModTool (https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool/releases/download/0.8.3.0/UndertaleModTool_v0.8.3.0-Windows-SingleFile.zip). This is ***REQUIRED*** for the loader to work. Once you have it installed (which means it is NOT in a zipped/ compressed file and is unzipped) then you can move on.
# 1. Locate your game folder
You can find this in steam by clicking the settings icon on the game page and hovering over 'Manage' you should see a button labled 'Browse local files'. Click on it to open your game files.

# 2. Unzipping the loader
All you need to do is copy your desired file you downloaded (https://github.com/PamTheDev/AFQM-CC-Loader/releases/tag/Stable) and paste it in your game files folder so it is located there. Then, Simply unzip it to finish this step.
