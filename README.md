# A few Quick Matches: Custom Character Loader
A simple UMT script that imports Custom Character Scripts and sprites directly into the game easily.

# How It Works
The mod loader adds any associated gml scripts, and any associated art for a custom character given it is insde of the "Character Assets" folder.
# How to use 
## 0. 
First before any mod loading, you need UndertaleModTool (https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool/releases/download/0.8.3.0/UndertaleModTool_v0.8.3.0-Windows-SingleFile.zip). This is ***REQUIRED*** for the loader to work. Once you have it installed (which means it is NOT in a zipped/ compressed file and is unzipped) then you can move on.
## 1. Locate your game folder
You can find this in steam by clicking the settings icon on the game page and hovering over 'Manage' you should see a button labled 'Browse local files'. Click on it to open your game files.

## 2. Unzipping the loader
All you need to do is copy your desired file you downloaded (https://github.com/PamTheDev/AFQM-CC-Loader/releases/tag/Stable) and paste it in your game files folder so it is located there. Then, Simply unzip it to finish this step.

## 3. Loading your characters
Now that everything is unzipped and in the right places, you can now try running the script. To run the script, open your 'data.win' file that is in your game files, it should have a blue heart looking object as it's icon.

*If your data.win file does not look like that than refer back to step  0. to see how to install UndertaleModTool.*

Now that your data.win file is open, click on the scripts button, then on the dropdown menu, click 'Run other scripts'

Then, select the folder you unzipped in step 2. and select the "ImportCharacters.csx" file.

After that, another popup window should appear asking for you to select a folder, all you need to do is highlight the 'Character Assets' folser and click 'Select Folder'.

## 5. Finishing up
Next, a few popup windows will appear **ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HIT 'CONFIRM' OR 'OK'** until it says the scripts are finished.

*(This is the final popup that should appear)*

# 6. THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP
REMEMBER TO SAVE THE FILE. YOU CAN DO THIS BY CLICKING 'FILE -> SAVE' OR BY CLICKING 'CTRL+S'.

THEN ON HE WINDOW THAT POPS UP JUST CLICK THE SAVE BUTTON IN THE CORNER.

Finally, once the file has saved, close out of UMT and open up A Few Quick Matches; the characters should be there just right.
