# How it works
The script uses the scripts that are in UMT and reads them IF they are .gml files (because reasons). So, this guide will help to port your mods so that they can be distirbuted easily.

## 1. Converting the scripts
First off, the first thing to note when dealing with ANY GML file or JSON file that you make for this loader is that you CANNOT use sprite NUMBERS. 

All you need to do to convert the numbers to names is to simply middle click the sprite number, then click the name in the dropdown that pops up.
